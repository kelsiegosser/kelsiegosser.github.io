Early on in the pandemic, around March of 2020, a colleague posted on an internal thread asking if there would be any interest in writing an interactive article for the Society of Actuaries (SOA) Technology Newsletter. I immediately jumped on this opportunity and reached out to a peer to see if he would be interested in joining. After many months of back and forth, trying to decide what to write about, what data to use, etc, we came up with our article: "What's in a Number? Considerations for Mapping the COVID-19 Pandmic".

My husband and I eloped during the pandemic. We wanted to have a wedding celebration in my home town, but with the pandemic raging, we ultimately decided not to have it. Regardless, I was prepared and created this site in case we would be able to celebrate!

While creating our wedding celebration site, I used the same template that I created for our wedding site, but made it a dark theme.

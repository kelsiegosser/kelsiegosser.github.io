## Background

Milliman is a consulting actuarial firm that started moving into the product space about 20 years ago. Up until recently, though, the product space was relatively small. Now there are lots of products being created all of the time, but despite having branding guidelines, the look and feel of each product was drastically different depending on who was creating them. For years I struggled to design my team’s products consistently and was thinking that something like a design system would go a long way for me personally. This is how the idea was generated to create a design system for our firm.

## Product Design Team

A designer joined our firm working for a different office, but I was introduced to her right away. I shared my idea with her and she felt it would make a huge difference for our company to have a design system. Luckily, she had experience working with design systems and was able to guide us in the right direction from the beginning.
We were assigned a product manager to help keep us on track and we began the process of figuring out how to create a design system in our spare time. 
After presenting to stakeholders in our firm and getting buy in to create a design system, we found two software developers with interest in design and a willingness to assist with the design system.

## Prototyping Tools

The first thing we did was evaluate prototyping tools for our design system. We looked into Figma, Sketch, and InVision. Sketch is for Mac's only, and our company uses PC’s so we ruled that out right away. InVision was good, but still in its infancy, so we were reluctant to use it. We landed on Figma because it fit all of our needs, was browser-based, and easy for existing designers to use and adopt.

## Evaluating Design Systems

Next we evaluated existing design systems: Material Design, Carbon Design, and Lightning Design. We decided on Carbon because the feel of the design system most closely compared to our company’s look and feel. Additionally, we were able to bring their design system in from the design side by importing into Sketch and then importing to Figma. We were also able to use their code to bring into our GitHub instance for developers to use.

## Creating the Design System

Finally, we were able to change all existing colors to be Milliman brand colors; updated typography to a font that would work best with our branded font; and we decided to use Material Design iconography because it fit better with our brand.

## Rolling it out

After about a year, we rolled out the design system to the firm. We did several presentations and create quarterly newsletters around the design system and have seen a big uptake on usage of both the design system and Figma firmwide.

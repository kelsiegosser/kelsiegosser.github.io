### Overview

We were asked to choose a prompt for the duration of the course. My prompt was to create a Services Summary App for a Hospital.

#### The product

Seaside Hospital would like an easy way for patients to view their services summary for past visits, with the ability to pay for bills using an app. This app targets patients of the Seaside Hospital System.

#### Project overview

##### The problem:

Many people donâ€™t understand the services that are being performed and why when they visit the hospital. They also would like to pay for their bills using an app rather than by mail or phone.  

##### The goal:

Bring clarity to services rendered at the hospital or by a doctor around what was performed, why it was performed, and how much they owe for the services.  

##### My role:

Lead UX Designer  

##### Responsibilities:

- User research by conducting interviews
- Paper and digital wireframing
- Low and high fidelity prototyping
- Conducting usability studies
- Accounting for accessibility
- Iterating on design
- Communicating with stakeholders and developers

## Milliman Medical Index

The Milliman Medical Index (MMI) measures healthcare costs for individuals and families receiving coverage from an employer-sponsored preferred provider organization (PPO) plan.

The results of the MMI are published annually with an article, and more recently, an interactive BI tool which allows users to input their demographics and see how their costs compare with the cost of healthcare for a hypothetical American family of four.

## Background

I met a peer from another office within our firm in 2018 who shared an interest in good data visualization and design. We began to talk regularly, and in 2019, he shared the [2019 Milliman Medical Index](https://www.milliman.com/en/insight/2019-milliman-medical-index) (MMI) tool to see if I would be interested in working with him to revamp it and make it more usable for end users.

After viewing the report, I was very excited to see how we could polish up the tool using improved design standards and including user experience in the redesign.

We reached out to the MMI committee to see if they would be receptive to having us redesign the tool. We were pleased to hear that they would be open to a redesign and were supportive of our efforts.

## Requirements gathering

After we received approval to move forward with a redesign, we began generating questions to ask our stakeholders so that we could better understand the requirements for this tool.

## Prototyping 

I began prototyping based on the existing tool, data available, and information gathered during the requirements gathering process. My peer assisted by giving feedback on what would be possible while using Power BI as a tool for surfacing the visualizations along with his expertise in the subject matter. We worked together to meet the requirements and improve the design of the existing tool.

## Presenting to stakeholders

After we were content with the prototype, we presented it to our stakeholders, the MMI committee. We obtained feedback based on the prototype and figured out what updates would need to be made to address the feedback we received.

I went back to the prototype in Figma, made changes to reflect what we had learned in the stakeholders meeting, and then passed the prototype off to my peer, who would be developing the tool in Power BI.

## Development, testing, review, & final touches

My peer worked with Power BI to develop the product using the prototype that I put together in Figma. He was able to extract colors, typography, sizing, spacing, etc from the Figma prototype to help design and develop the tool. 

Next, we performed testing on the Power BI document and then handed it off for an official peer review. Once the review was completed, we needed to make a few final touches before the Power BI tool was embedded in the article.

## Final product

Once the tool was complete, we were able to submit it for publication to sit with the article itself.

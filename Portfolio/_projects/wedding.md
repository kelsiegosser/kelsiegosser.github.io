My husband and I decided to elope in the Virgin Islands. Getting married on a tropical beach gave me the freedom to design and develop our wedding site using a fun, vibrant, tropical beach theme. 

I was really torn while trying to decide how to design our wedding website. This was the first time I was able to create a website from scratch using my own design interests rather than following work design standards. I teetered between having a more traditional themed website for our wedding versus a fun and funky website that matched our beach themed wedding. Ultimately, I decided to have fun and create a loud, vibrant wedding website for our guests to view leading up to the wedding.

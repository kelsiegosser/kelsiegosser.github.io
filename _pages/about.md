**Milliman Design System**: Created and implemented a design system for use firmwide. This was accomplished by finding peers in the firm with interest in UX, design, and software development, creating a group, researching design systems, choosing Carbon Design System and modifying it to use Milliman branded colors, typography, and iconography. Implemented this design system in Figma for designers to use, and ported it into GitHub for developers to use.

I am very passionate about the environment. Helping our planet is something I strive to do on a daily basis. A few of my more concentrated efforts include:
- Creating and running the Green Team in Milliman's Indianapolis Office
- Joined the "GUTSI" (Ground-Up Think Tank for Social Impact) challenge to help address issues with climate change
- Scheduling and working with Keep Indianapolis Beautiful annually with my team at Milliman
- Picking up trash around neighborhoods
- Composting at home
- Carless since October 2021 (this doesn't stop me from getting around!)

### Big Brothers Big Sisters

I became a Big Sister in July 2018. My Little Sister is vibrant, smart, and passionate about her friends and family. It has been such a rewarding experience to be her Big Sister.

### Learning Portuguese

My husband and his family are from Brazil which has inspired me to learn Portuguese. Feel free to add me on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/kelsiegosser?via=share_profile)!
